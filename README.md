# **Gaea's Haven**

>We are all born beautiful, the greatest tragedy is being convinced we are not.


Hello, I am Gaea! I am 15 years old, born on the 27th of February. I am an INFP, which makes me a very creative and caring person. I lean more on depending on our feelings than being logical, unless it's a situation where I do need to be logical. If you want to know more about me then sit back and read through the rest of my webpage!

# **More about me:**


- I am a very slow person, mentally and socially.
  It takes me a while to process things and put things into words. Sometimes I mistake what people say and I still need others to repeat what they tell me multiple times just so I could finally get what is being said.
     
- I am an empath.
  I can easily tell what others are feeling by just one look.
     
- I am sensitive.
  By sensitive I mean that I am quick to react to certain situations. Even one insult, joke, or bad rumour about me can make me start crying.
     
- I am creative
  Being creative makes me come up with a lot of ideas and plans for certain assignments given to me. But sometimes having a lot of ideas can crowd my mind and in the end I am left staring at a blank paper, unable to start anything.
     
- I always try
  As said by my friend, I always try and do the best I can for others, even when my help doesn't help at all.
  
- I easily get bored
  I may not look like it but I get bored very easily. I preffer to do something fun at any given moment, or to at least busy myself with my hobbies or interests.

Hobbies:
- Drawing/ Sketching
- Reading
- Making podcasts for myself
- Daydreaming
     
Likes:
- First thing on the list, I like whales. 
     For me, whales in general make me calm, their shape and how they move in the ocean, slowly but steady. I've seen artworks of whales before and their image is refreshing to look at.
- Understanding people. 
     These kinds of people make me feel safe and calm. They reassure and make sure no one look bad in any given situation.
- Daydreaming.
     As said in my hobbies, I love daydreaming. Day dreaming helps me boost my imagination and give myself ideas what to draw.
- The fantasy genre
     I love this type of genre because it includes magical beings and settings. This genre also strengthens my imagination and somehow gives me the carefree vibe.
- Sky Lanterns.
     Sky Lanterns are very beautiful for me. Just like stars they make the sky look pretty and they continue to float up the sky. They also give me a magical vibe.
