>We are all born beautiful, the greatest tragedy is being convinced we are not.

Hello, I am Gaea! I am 15 years old, born on the 27th of February. I am an INFP, which makes me a very creative and caring person. I lean more on depending on our feelings than being logical, unless it's a situation where I do need to be logical. If you want to know more about me then sit back and read through the rest of my webpage!
